              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              
              <p>I am a Second-Year Software Engineering Student who is on the path to a first in their degree. Below I have provided some frequently asked questions so you can get to know me a little better.</p>

              <h2>Why Software Engineering?</h2>
              <p>Before going to University, I took an apprentice @ Koneqt where I helped develop CRM's (Customer Relationship Management Systems), POS (Point of Sale Systems) and custom screens for businesses that would help them make use of their data. After realising that I liked the subject and job I then decided to pursue Software Engineering as a career.</p>

              <h2>Current Interests?</h2>
              <p>Note: Currently, I am extremely busy with my University Coursework and haven't had time to pursue a lot of these interests (as much as I'd like to).</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Cyber Security (Reverse Engineering)</li>
                <li>Android Development / Web Application Development</li>

              <h2>What am I looking for / Where am I heading?</h2>
              <p>Currently, I am unsure of what I want to specialize in. I have a variety of interests and like learning. I guess I am somewhat of a Philomath?.

                Web development is the future as it provides a way to create products that are easy to use and completely cross-platform without needing to worry about system compatibility and while I enjoy web development. I would also like the opportunity to develop other skillsets.</p>

                  <h2>Profile</h2>
                  <p>I am second-year BSc (Hons) Software Engineering student at the University of Brighton with a background in Web Software Development and on track to achieve a First. I am highly motivated and believe communication is crucial to a great team; I enjoy interacting with customers and staff to offer quality service. I can pick up skills quickly and am highly adaptable. Through my studies and varied work experience I have developed a broad skillset and I am eager to learn and progress. I am very keen to secure a sandwich year in industry to further apply and develop my software skills and gain valuable professional experience. </p>
